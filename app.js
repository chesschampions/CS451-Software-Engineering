// Check if newgame is requested and set up a new session

//    If session is requested but not found, throw error message to client that's displayed by the client

// Board state is represented by 2D array
// X is red O is black
// Coordinates and type of piece are sent to the server for validation, if it passed board state is pushed
// If not an error is displayed

// Upon disconnection of one user an error message is displayed and all board moves sent are told to kindly fuck off
// Upon disconnection of both users the session is archived by saving the board state to a file, and putting it away.
